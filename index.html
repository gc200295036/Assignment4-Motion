    <h1>#1 - Keyframe Animation</h1>
    <p>This is an example of a simple keyframe animation, that slides to the right and back to the left. Changes it's colour, Can play 1 - infinite amount of times and also uses CSS animation and the @keyframe rule</p>

    <h2>#2 - Youtube Subscribe Button Animation</h2>
    <p>I wanted to make a youtube subscribe button so I did! This button uses javascript to switch the text output when a user clicks</p>
    <button onclick="buttonClick()" class="myButton" id="myButton">Subscribe</button>

    <h3>#3 - Transform on Hover Animation </h3>

    <div class="hoverTransition"></div>

    <h4>#4 - JavaScript Animation!</h4>
    <p>This animation uses javascript I wanted to simulate the sun moving around the earth, I was pretty amazed when I saw Jeremy's lesson 8 with the solar planets I wanted to make my own version of that. This is just very simple but can be improved upon to make it look more like the sun and more like earth!
